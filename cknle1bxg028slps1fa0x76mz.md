## How to make your website for Free on Github

As a developer, you might well be familiar with **Github** and its myriad of uses.

#### Did you know, you can host your own **personal website** on GitHub for free?

If the answer is **No** please read along. 

[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) bloggers are in for a surprise ðŸ˜‡

***GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. ***

**Microsoft**, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, initiated an acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion in June 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software-as-a-service** (SaaS)** business model, was started in 2008. 

**Git**, an open-source code management system is a brainchild of a **genius** named **[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)**.

**Git**, like other **version control** systems, manages and stores revisions of projects. Although itâ€™s mostly used for code, Git could be used to manage any other type of file, such as Word documents or Final Cut projects. Think of it as a filing system for every draft of a document.

You can also build your own **personal website** on **GitHub** for **free** and Git will host it for you.

## Prerequisites

***First things first***. You need to have an account on Github.

- Create a **GitHub** account if you don't have one, [sign up here](https://github.com/join) 

- It takes a minute. This is where your **website code ** is hosted for free.  

- It would be helpful to understand what **Markdown** is and how to write it. 

- Markdown is just a way to take a piece of text and format it to look a little nicer.  

***Note*** - If you started blogging on **Hashnode** then you already know the **basics** of **markdown** and its syntax - So it must be easy for you guys to pick from where you started to build your own pages

> Please go through this simple tutorial to learn the basics of **markdown** 

[Useful tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/)


> I am going to give you **2 options** for building and hosting your own website.

1. The hard way ðŸ¤¨

2. The highway ðŸ˜œ

# 1. Github Pages - "The hard way"

You can use GitHub **Pages** to host a website about **yourself**, your **organization**, or your **project** directly from a GitHub **repository**.

**GitHub Pages** is a static site hosting service that takes **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** files straight from a repository on GitHub optionally runs the files through a build process and publishes a website.

#### Head over to this page and follow the instructions.

 [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

>When I said the **hard way** I meant you have to do the reading ðŸ¤“, not that it is literally hard ðŸ™„. We are developers, nothing is hard to figure out with the right guidance.

# 2. Beautiful Jekyll - "The highway"

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create a website quickly. Perfect for **personal blogs** or simple project **websites**.  

> **Plagiarism** is the **Sincerest** Form of **Flattery** ðŸ¤—

[Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes.  

You can also look at [my personal website](https://kushalpagolu.github.io) and if you like the changes I made you can **fork** my repository


## Build your website in 3 steps

### 1. Fork this repository from GitHub

Fork this [repository](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io) by clicking the *Fork* button on the top right corner.


![Screen Shot 2021-04-16 at 1.28.42 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618618054549/zfeBb_5JU.png)


> If you like the changes I made to my [Github website](https://kushalpagolu.github.io). You can fork my [repo](https://github.com/kushalpagolu/kushalpagolu.github.io) instead. 

 [Click Here](https://github.com/kushalpagolu/kushalpagolu.github.io) to go to my repo and perform the **fork** step with it. 

I made changes of my own. For starters I used index.md file instead of the default index.html from the Kratzer repository.

### 2. Rename the repository to <yourusername>.github.io

Once you **fork** your desired repo **Settings** tab is now available.

- Click on **Settings** at the top (the cog icon) and there you'll have an option to rename.

![Screen Shot 2021-04-16 at 1.22.18 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618618158691/lMEPwgseD.png)


This will create a **GitHub User page** ready with the **Beautiful Jekyll** template that will be available at ***http://<yourusername>.github.io***.  


### 3. Customize your website settings

Edit the **_config.yml** file to change all the settings to reflect your site. 

- To edit the file, **click on it** and then click on the **pencil icon **.

![Screen Shot 2021-04-16 at 8.32.43 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618621249020/5IV5arcIy.png)

- The settings in the file are self-explanatory and comments were added inside the file to help you further. 

- Any line that begins with a pound sign (`#`) is a comment, and the rest of the lines are actual settings.


**Note: If you like both the repo's then you can mix it by making minimal changes** 

## Add your own content

To add **pages** to your site, you can either write a **markdown** file (`.md`) or you can write an **HTML** file.  

You can look at some files on this site to get an idea of how to write markdown. 
To look at existing files, click on any file that ends in `.md`, for example [aboutme.md](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io/blob/master/aboutme.md). 

On the **page**, you can see some nicely formatted text (there is a word in bold, a link, bullet points), and if you click on the **pencil icon** to edit the file, you will see the **markdown** that generated the pretty text.

In contrast, look at [`index.html`](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io) in Frederik Kratzert repo. That's how you write HTML. If you are good with **HTML** and **CSS** then you can make much better website.

Any file that you add inside the [_posts](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io/tree/master/_posts) directory will be treated as a blog entry. You can look at the existing files there to get an idea of how to write blog posts.  

After you successfully add your **own post**, you can delete the existing files inside [`_posts`](https://github.com/kushalpagolu/kushalpagolu.github.io/tree/master/_posts) to remove the **sample posts**, as they are just demo posts to help you learn.

**Note: ** The blogposts from **Hashnode** can directly be copied into new .md files as they are already formatted in **markdown**. 

## Last important thing: YAML front matter ("parameters" for a page)

In order to have your new pages use this template and not just be plain pages, you need to add [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to the top of each page. 

This is where you'll give each page some parameters that I made available, such as a title and subtitle. I'll go into more detail about what parameters are available later. If you don't want to use any parameters on your new page (this also means having no title), then use the empty YAML front matter:

```
---
---
```

If you want to use any parameters, write them between the two lines. For example, you can have this at the top of a page:

```
---
title: Contact me
subtitle: Here you'll find all the ways to get in touch with me
---
```

You can look at the top of [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md) or [`index.html`](./index.html) as more examples.

**Important takeaway: ALWAYS add the YAML front matter, which is two lines with three dashes, to EVERY page. If you have any parameters, they go between the two lines.** Â  Â 

If you don't include **YAML** then your file will not use the **template**.

# Features

All the **below features** are explained on the **README.md** file in the repo of [Frederik Kratzert](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io), the repo I used as a base from.

In fact, he did a much better job with a **video** and in-depth explanation of how to make your own website on his [repository](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io) on the same file.

## Credits

I am glad that I found this **repo** and used it for my website. I am learning new skills and making my website more beautiful. I am amazed at the simplicity of it. I was thrilled to know that GitHub supports markdown language and hashnode blogging taught me the basics of Markdown language.

The best part is the website looks more beautiful and professional on mobile.

I would like to thank **Frederik Kratzert** [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/fkratzert) for the [github repo](https://github.com/kratzert/kratzert.github.io).

## Known limitations

- If you have a project page and you want a custom 404 page, you must have a custom domain.  See https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/.  This means that if you have a regular User Page you can use the 404 page from this theme, but if it's a website for a specific repository, the 404 page will not be used.
